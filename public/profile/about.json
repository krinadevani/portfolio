    "about": "Hi, I am Krina! I'm currently a graduate student at Northeastern University in Boston, majoring in Computer Science. I also hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering. My passion lies in solving complex problems, and as a student, I'm eagerly exploring the world of computer science to expand my knowledge and skills.\n\n I have gained industry experience as a full stack developer for 2.7 years where I learned to write clear clean code that is both highly maintainable and easy to understand. \n In my recent years of software engineering, I spent my time exploring other interesting computer science fields - primarily cloud computing where I delved into various services and technologies to enhance my skills in designing scalable, resilient, and cost-effective cloud-native applications. \n\n I have always been an enthusiastic learner looking for ways to hone my existing skills and acquire new ones. I strongly believe in the effectiveness of experiential learning and am constantly seeking opportunities to put my knowledge into practice.",
