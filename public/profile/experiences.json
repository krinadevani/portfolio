                "Currently, I am doing my co-op at Amazon Robotics, where I have consistently delivered results by being involved in the end-to-end software development life cycle. I ensured the on-time delivery of a time-sensitive project, while upholding the highest standards in both the codebase and design processes. I took full ownership of gathering both technical and non-technical requirements, aligning project objectives with stakeholder expectations. Additionally, I proactively expanded the existing codebase, enhancing vertical scalability and improving the overall user experience. Driven by a passion for continuous improvement, I embraced a learning mindset, diving deep into learning technologies/services such as AWS and Kotlin to further contribute to the team's success."
